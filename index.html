            What I currently do:

        <ul>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <span class="bg-primary-subtle p-1 rounded-2 text-dark">FREELANCER (CONTRACTOR - Upwork).</span> I am currently working as a L2 technical support for a SAAS company based in San Francisco, California. My day-to-day responsibilities include:
                <ol>
                    <li class="mb-2">Provide general customer service (how to's, pricing, etc.)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">CSS customizations</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">API how-to's</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Support agents in handling billing-related concerns (L2 approvals)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <span class="bg-primary-subtle p-1 rounded-2 text-dark">WEBDEV STUDENT.</span> I've been studying web development to become a front-end web developer for 4 years but I haven't made it yet. I can't count the times I've given up yet here am I, creating my first ever blog. You know what they said, it's not about your failures, it's about how you get up.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <span class="bg-primary-subtle p-1 rounded-2 text-dark">FULL TIME DAD.</span> Currently a bestfriend of a 5-year old cutie who loves pokemons, dressing up, curious, and shy as hell. She can drive me and her mom crazy sometimes. She is such a blessing for the family. 
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <span class="bg-primary-subtle p-1 rounded-2 text-dark">ATHELETE.</span> I have been taking great care more of myself physically (and mentally) more than ever. Working out is one of my non-negotiables. I lift weights and do boxing for my cardio.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4">
                <span class="bg-primary-subtle p-1 rounded-2 text-dark">READER.</span> Reading has done wonders for me. I've read several books about personal development and psychology. I've never read any fantasy or sci-fi books; I don't really like them for some reason and I would prefer watching movies instead. I don't have a favorite book in particular but the one that had the greatest impact to me was Stephen Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"
